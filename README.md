# Hello, Viewer ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maciej Piotrowski, known on the Internet as FlameHorizon or Flame.

## What I'm doing?

In working hours I'm dealing with a lot of data and making sure that all the system are working fine which isn't that easy when you are dealing with staff which are 10 years old+.

## what I'm doing outside of work?

I'm intrested in solving puzzles, that is why I made a CLI tool for Number Match mobile game (https://github.com/FlameHorizon/number-match-solver) and compling Advent of Code channales (https://github.com/FlameHorizon/AdventOfCode). 

I like cheap flights, that is why I have made Flight Scanner (https://github.com/FlameHorizon/flight-scanner).

Also I dabble with Game Dev. world where 
- I've created own Battle Engine which simulates turn based combat in Final Fantasy IX (https://github.com/FlameHorizon/BattleEngine)
- helped with port of Final Fantasy IX engine which can be modded (https://github.com/Albeoris/Memoria)
- created a mod for Stardew Valley called ProductionStats (https://github.com/FlameHorizon/ProductionStats)

At some point I've also wokred on VBA where:
- made a python tool to generate documentation (https://github.com/FlameHorizon/vba-docgen)
- made a library called Lapis which brings a lot of functions known from .NET to VBA (https://github.com/FlameHorizon/Lapis). Who said we can't have reflection and labmda expresions.
