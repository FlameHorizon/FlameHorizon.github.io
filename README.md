# Hello, Viewer ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maciej Piotrowski, known on the Internet as FlameHorizon or Flame.

## What I'm doing?

In working hours I'm dealing with a lot of data and making sure that all the system are working fine which isn't that easy when you are dealing with staff which are 10 years old+. I'm using mostly following things:
- C# + .NET (from Framework 4.6 to Core 8).
- T-SQL (enough to get work done)
- Zabbix
- Git
- ActiveX and COM objects
- some PowerShell/CMD magic

## What I'm doing outside of work?

I'm intrested in solving puzzles, that is why I made a CLI tool for Number Match mobile game [Number Match Solver](https://github.com/FlameHorizon/number-match-solver) and competing in [Advent of Code](https://github.com/FlameHorizon/AdventOfCode) challanges. 

I like cheap flights, that is why I have made [Flight Scanner](https://github.com/FlameHorizon/flight-scanner) which allows to find cheapest filights between two given dates for a given route.

Also I've dabble with Game Dev. world where:
- I've created own [Battle Engine]((https://github.com/FlameHorizon/BattleEngine)) which simulates turn based combat in Final Fantasy IX 
- helped with port of [Final Fantasy IX engine](https://github.com/Albeoris/Memoria) which can be modded
- created a mod for Stardew Valley called [ProductionStats](https://github.com/FlameHorizon/ProductionStats) which right now have around 1.1k downloads (2024-04-21).

At some point I've also wokred on VBA where:
- made a python tool [vba-docgen]((https://github.com/FlameHorizon/vba-docgen)) to generate documentation 
- made a library called [Lapis](https://github.com/FlameHorizon/Lapis) which brings a lot of functions known from .NET to VBA. Who said we can't have reflection and labmda expresions.
